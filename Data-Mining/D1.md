# Day 01 Notes: Data Mining & Models

Today, I learned some new concepts about Data Mining, models, and the tools used in this field.

**Data Mining**: Making predictions on new data based on past data.  
**Tools**: Models.

I learned about two main types of models: **Supervised** and **Unsupervised**.

### Supervised
- Has both inputs (features) and outputs (labels).
- Goal: Predict the correct answer for new data based on what the model has learned.
- Examples: Classification, Regression.

### Unsupervised
- Has only inputs (features), with no labels.
- Goal: Find patterns, similarities, or differences in the data.
- Example: Clustering.

Both types are used for prediction, but their goals are different:
- Supervised → Predict a specific outcome.
- Unsupervised → Group similar data points or discover patterns.

### Data Basics
- Columns → Features
- Rows → Data points (data vectors)
- Dataset → A matrix of rows and columns
- Model → A function with parameters used for prediction

📍 **Important note**:  
Classification models require labels. If there are no labels, the problem is not classification—it may be clustering, but not classification.

Tomorrow (Day 2), I plan to dive deeper into each example.
